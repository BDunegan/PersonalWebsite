## Level Up Your JavaScript Game

JavaScript is a versatile language, and here are some neat tricks to improve your coding efficiency:

- Use `??` (Nullish Coalescing) for default values.
- Use `?.` (Optional Chaining) to avoid errors when accessing properties.
- Convert a string to a number with `+` (e.g., `+ "42"` becomes `42`).
- Use `Object.keys(obj).length` to get an object's size.
- Destructure arrays and objects for cleaner syntax.

Learning these tricks will make you a more efficient JavaScript developer!
