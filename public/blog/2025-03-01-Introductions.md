### Brandon... Do you really need a blog?
My name is Brandon Dunegan and this—as you’ve likely noticed—is my personal website. I designed this website from scratch to fill a niche which I have not seen done before: the exploration of the intersection of technology and philosophy and discovery of how best we should go about interacting with our ever-changing world.  

### Professional Development meets Philisophical Development
The "Resume" section of this website is dedicated to professional development and technical projects I have worked on. It is the page for the *artes servile*- to borrow the term used by Josef Pieper.  

This page, the "Blog", is then used correspondingly to contain thoughts and ideas related to the more metaphysical world- the *artes liberales*. This is the section of the site where my thoughts on the ways we, people as a cultural entity, interact with technology. The "Blog" may contain full or fragmented writings of mine, ideas on current culture or technology, or meerly quotes from people I am currently reading!  

I hope that by reading this, you choose to follow my progressive journey to beterment and in the best case, see something here which inspires you to continue the conversation.
